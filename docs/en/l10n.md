# Localisation (l10n)
Being a large project, LiveG OS and gShell require many aspects of the system to be localised. Due to its modular nature, gShell has multiple l10n files that need to be localised, including the separate l10n files for each system app. This page serves as a guide for how and where to localise LiveG OS and gShell. You can learn more about [l10n in Adapt UI](https://docs.liveg.tech/?product=adaptui&page=localising-apps.md) by visiting its documentation.

Here is a list of l10n files that need translating in gShell, as well as other files that would need translating in different repos:

* `shell/locales/*.json`
* `shell/oobs/*.json`
* `shell/apps/settings/l10n.json`
* `shell/apps/settings/locales/*.json`
* [LiveGTech/OS-Updates](https://github.com/LiveGTech/OS-Updates): `releases/index.json`

## Keyboard input/Input Method Editor
For LiveG OS to be fully-localised, the [Input Method Editor (IME)](input.md) also needs .gkbl and .gime files at the paths `shell/input/layouts` and `shell/input/imedata` respectively for each language. This ensures that those who wish to type text in a supported language can do so as they would expect on other operating systems.

The creation of IME training data (used for typing suggestions and non-alphabetical character input) is performed in our specialised [IME Training](https://github.com/LiveGTech/IMETraining) repository, and it is recommended that this is done for each supported language.
